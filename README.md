# Web Personalization Examples
Each subject covered has a corresponding guide on [Learn Lytics](https://learn.lytics.com/). Links to the guide and the directory containing the code example are provided. Examples may contain CSS, Javascript, and an HTML file, which when viewed in the browser will allow you to preview the example. Some examples may also contain .sh file which contains an example curl command on how to make API Overrides for the example if it was built as a [Lytics Web Personalize Experience](https://learn.lytics.com/understanding/product-docs/orchestrate/experiences). It is recommended the you clone the full repo rather than downloading individual assets. You may run a [Python simple server](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html) to browse the files:

```sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

Or simply open the HTML file for each example to preview it.
